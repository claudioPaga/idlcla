Lista dei programmi scritti while at Penn State

lrpd_rec.pro		    Event (grades) reconstruction for LrPD frames.
lrpd_bias_corr.pro	    Corrects the bias for a list of LrPD frames.
			    When background is high the Bias subtraced on
			    board is too low.  The correct bias should be
			    the median value of the 20 pixel in the file
			    headers.  This programs creates new fits files
			    with the corrected bias
lrpd_bias_plot.pro	    As above but it just makes plots of bias sub 
			    and median of the header pixels, does not correct
lrpd_bias_plot_man.pro	    As above, makes plots but the median value is not
			    read from the header parameter but is actually
			    calculated in the program getting rid of the
			    pixels whose value is above 400 (they are probably
			    SAA protons, and so they are not bias!)
